# Wikipedia Search 

This is the second project where I hit an API and mapped the results to be displayed as Wikipedia snippets.

## User Stories
&check;  I can type in a term or topic into an input.

&check;  As I click the search button it will display previews of Wikipedia articles related to my search term.

&check;  When I click on one of the previews it will open up a new page and take me to the Wikipedia article.

## Lessons Learned
- Async/Await to make API calls.

- Optional chaining.
  
- Working with JSON.


## Getting Started

1.  npm install
2.  npm run start
3.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
